                Charity has been attributed as helping the underprivileged, which includes a wide range of products. The term charity is often misinterpreted. Studies show that majority of people think of charity in terms of donating money. However, charity generally means the voluntary giving of help; help in terms of giving one’s time to someone or donating one’s things. Though public donations are necessary to support people in need, where government funding is limited, charity in any form can help a person live a better life. According to research, charity organizations are struggling to raise more help from the public to help the needy and they are facing a declining trend.
